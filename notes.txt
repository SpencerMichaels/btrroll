- Check if running in initrd and bail out if not
- Present a menu with the following options:
  - Manage snapshots
  - Drop to a shell
  - Reboot
  - Shutdown
  - Exit (continue booting)


NOTE:
  Menus should be implemented in plain text
  An alternate mode can use `dialog` if the binary is available
